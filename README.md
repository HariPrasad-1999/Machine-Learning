# Case Study(1) :

According to the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) Sustainable Buildings and Climate Initiative, construction trade contributes as much as 30% to all global greenhouse gas emissions and consumes up to 40% of all energy used worldwide. 
Climate change is currently having a powerful impact on how buildings are designed and constructed.

A Multivariate multiple regression model to study this effect of eight input variables on two output variables, which are the heating load and the cooling load, of residential buildings. 
The data provided is from the energy analysis data of 768 different building shapes. 
The features provided are the relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area and glazing area distribution.

<h2>Simple Linear Regression</h2>

A simple linear regression model estimates the relationship between two quantitative variables where one is referred to as the independent variable and the other the dependent variable. The independent variable (X) is used to predict and also called the predictor while the predicted variable is referred to as the response variable (Y) (e.g. finding the relationship between the amount of CO2 gas emitted and the number of trees cut down). The value of Y can be obtained from X by finding the line of best fit (regression line) with minimum error for the data points on a scatter plot for both variables. A simple linear regression can be represented as:
